## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Animal Feed Planning
1. Add feed item (e.g., Cow Feed - 50kg/bag, $100/bag)
2. Calculate: 5kg/time × 2x/day × 1 animal
3. See: Daily 10kg, 10-day 100kg, 30-day 300kg
4. Cost: 6 bags/10days × $100 = $600/10days

### Scenario 2: Multi-Item Distribution
1. Add multiple items: Corn, Alfalfa, Supplements
2. Create chart with all 3 items
3. Set portions: Corn 3kg, Alfalfa 2kg, Supplement 0.5kg
4. System calculates combined costs
5. See per-item breakdown

### Scenario 3: Cost Comparison
1. Create two different charts (Plan A vs Plan B)
2. View calculations for both
3. Compare 30-day costs
4. Choose the more economical option

## Understanding the Math

### Basic Formula
```
Daily Quantity = Quantity per Time × Times per Day × Number of Animals
Cost for 10 Days = (Daily Quantity × 10) ÷ Bag Size × Price per Bag
```

### Example Breakdown
**Feed Item:** Corn
- Size: 50kg per bag
- Price: $100 per bag

**Usage:**
- 3kg per feeding
- 2 feedings per day
- 50 animals

**Results:**
- Daily: 3 × 2 × 50 = **300 kg**
- 10-day: 300 × 10 = **3,000 kg**
- Bags needed: 3,000 ÷ 50 = **60 bags**
- Cost: 60 × $100 = **$6,000**

## Tips & Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Create multiple feed items first
- Test with preview before saving calculations
- Use meaningful chart names (include date/season)
- Save successful charts as templates
- Export PDF for record-keeping

### ❌ DON'T:
- Create chart without feed items
- Forget to set number of animals
- Assume prices stay the same over time
- Delete items used in active calculations
- Ignore calculation previews

### 💡 PRO TIPS:
1. **Batch Operations:** Create all feed items first, then calculations
2. **Comparisons:** Create "Plan A" and "Plan B" charts to compare costs
3. **Templates:** Save successful charts as templates for reuse
4. **Exports:** Export monthly for budget tracking
5. **Categories:** Use categories to organize feeds by type

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I change a feed item's price?**
A: Go to Feed Items, find the item, click Edit (if available) or delete and recreate with new price.

**Q: Can I have different feeding schedules for different animals?**
A: Yes! Create separate charts for different animal types.

**Q: What if I need to plan for 45 days instead of 30?**
A: The 30-day calculation covers a month. For longer periods, multiply the 30-day cost.

**Q: Can I export multiple charts at once?**
A: Export one chart at a time. For multiple comparisons, export each and combine in Excel.

**Q: How accurate are the calculations?**
A: Calculations use exact arithmetic rounded to 2 decimal places. Bag counts use ceiling function (always rounds up to whole bags).

**Q: Can I undo a deletion?**
A: Deletions are permanent. Be careful when clicking Delete.

**Q: What's the difference between a calculation and a chart?**
A: Calculation = single item usage. Chart = combination of multiple items for a complete feeding plan.
